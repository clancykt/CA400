Loqui is an automated programming experience which allows users to code by speech. The desktop application implements automatic speech recognition technologies on a user-friendly interface where users can build and run Python programs through voice interaction in a 'programming-on-the-fly' approach. Users can interact with the intuitive interface using spoken commands processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques so the system can understand and execute them optimally.

The Loqui system consists of a Speech Recognition model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset to produce the best possible output based on the input data for optimal accuracy of speech synthesis and a desktop app interface which comprises a React app bundled with Electron and an API behind it for communication with the backend which includes data transfer and other means of communication.
